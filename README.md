# EasyMultisig
This repository contains a multisignature wallet implementation written in Solidity, based on the first version of the Gnosis Multisignature Wallet.

A multisignature wallet, also known as a multi-sig wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple signatures from different authorized parties to approve a transaction. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds.

This repository provides an implementation of a multisignature wallet in Solidity, based on the first version of the Gnosis Multisignature Wallet. It allows multiple Ethereum addresses to be designated as owners of the wallet, and a configurable number of owners must provide their signatures to approve a transaction.


## Prerequisites
To run and interact with the multisignature wallet, you'll need the following:

Node.js (v12 or higher)
Truffle (v5 or higher)
Ganache or a compatible Ethereum development network
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.


To deploy and interact with the multisignature wallet contract, follow these steps:

Make sure your local Ethereum development network (e.g., Ganache) is running.

Compile the contracts and deploy the multisignature wallet contract.

shell
Copy code
truffle migrate
Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly.

shell
Copy code
truffle test
Interact with the multisignature wallet contract using Truffle console or other Ethereum development tools.
